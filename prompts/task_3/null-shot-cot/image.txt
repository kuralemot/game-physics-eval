Look at examples in the “Examples” section and utilize examples and information from that section to perform the following task step-by-step.

You are a level designer for the Angry Birds game. You are given multiple images of structures over time. The first image shows the initial state of the structure at 0 seconds. 

The following images show possible outcomes after 10 seconds. 
Each outcome image is labeled with the elapsed time (e.g., 10s-A, 10s-B, ...).

Your task is to analyze the initial structure and predict what will happen to it after 10 seconds. Then, choose the outcome image that most accurately represents what will happen to the structure. Provide your reasoning, and give your final answer using the corresponding letter of the outcome image.

Output:
