Look at examples in the “Examples” section and utilize examples and information from that section to perform the following task step-by-step.

You are a level designer for the Angry Birds game. You are given multiple JSON texts of structures over time. The first JSON text shows the initial state of the structure at 0 seconds. 

The following JSON texts show possible outcomes after 10 seconds. 
Each outcome JSON text is labeled with the elapsed time (e.g., 10s-A, 10s-B, ...).

Your task is to analyze the initial structure and predict what will happen to it after 10 seconds. Then, choose the outcome JSON text that most accurately represents what will happen to the structure. Provide your reasoning, and give your final answer using the corresponding letter of the outcome JSON text.
